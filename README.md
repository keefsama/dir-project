dir-project
===========

Python script to add multiple directories based on your choice. 

This was done because i had to create multiple sub directories based on the parent dir and wanted something that was easy
enough to the point anyone could do it.

This is also my very first attempt at writing in python as i am currently trying to teach myself so there should be 
more to come and i am very excited.
